# console.log for C++

not that anyone wants it , or should want it. I just wanted to make it happen.

For my example to work it must be compiled with a C++14 or above compiler only because my
example of it,in main.cpp , uses a small feature in c++14 to make the long_number more
readable because it is a large number. Other than that you should be able to compile with
any compiler that supports c++11.
I compile with `clang++ -Wall -std=c++17 main.cpp -o main`
and run with `./main`
