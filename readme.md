# console.log for C++

not that anyone wants it , or should want it. I just wanted to make it happen.
I'd rather see a JavaScript std::cout but that isn't going to happen.

For my example to work it must be compiled with a C++14 and beoynd compiler only because my
example of its use in main.cpp uses a small feature in c++14 to make the long_number more
readable because it is a large number. Other than that you should be able to compile with
any compiler that supports c++11.
